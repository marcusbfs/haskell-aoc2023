# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in Haskell

This project aims to provide a somehow clean and efficient (sometimes!) solutions to the programming puzzles presented during the Advent of Code event.

## Usage

1. Place your input files in the `input` folder. Ensure that the file names follow the specified pattern.

2. Run the solutions using the following command:

```bash
cabal run
```

This will execute the main program and provide the solutions for each Advent of Code puzzle.

## Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains Haskell source files for each day's solution.
- `input/`: Place your input files here.
- `app/`: Contains the main program.
